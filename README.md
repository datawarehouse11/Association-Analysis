# Association-Analysis

This repository contains materials related to association analysis, a data mining technique used to discover interesting relationships between variables within datasets.  The materials cover both theoretical concepts and practical Python implementations.

## Contents

The repository includes the following:

* **Jupyter Notebooks:**
    * [Cars93.ipynb](./Cars93.ipynb):  Analysis of the "Cars93" dataset, exploring associations between car features.
    * [Iris.ipynb](./Iris.ipynb):  Analysis of the "Iris" dataset, demonstrating basic association concepts or related techniques.
* **Documents:**
    * [Association between categorical variables.docx](./Assocation%20between%20categorical%20variables.docx):  Explanation of the Chi-squared test for assessing associations between categorical variables.
    * [Association between two binary variables.docx](./Assocation%20between%20two%20binary%20variables.docx):  Explanation of the Phi coefficient for measuring associations between binary variables.
    * [Association Analysis using Python.docx](./Association%20Analysis%20using%20Python.docx):  General introduction to association analysis with Python.
    * [Correlation.docx](./Correlation.docx):  Explanation of correlation, a measure of the linear association between quantitative variables.
    * [Market Basket Analysis.docx](./Market%20Basket%20Analysis.docx):  Explanation of market basket analysis and related concepts (support, confidence, lift) for finding associations in transactional data.
* **Questions.txt**: A list of questions and answers related to the concepts.

## Key Concepts and Techniques Covered

This repository provides information and examples related to the following key concepts and techniques in association analysis:

* **Multivariate and Bivariate Analysis**: Explanation of these types of analysis.
* **Covariance**:  Measuring the degree to which two variables change together.
* **Correlation**: Measuring the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two quantitative variables (Pearson, Spearman, Kendall).
* **Chi-squared Test**:  Testing the independence of two categorical variables.
* **Phi Coefficient**: Measuring the association between two binary variables.
* **Market Basket Analysis**: Discovering associations between items in transactional data.
* **Association Rules**:  Identifying relationships between items, quantified by support, confidence, and lift.
* **Apriori Algorithm**:  An algorithm for efficiently finding frequent itemsets in transactional data.

## Target Audience

This repository is suitable for:

* Students learning data analysis and data mining.
