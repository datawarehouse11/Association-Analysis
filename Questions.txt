After importing the data with pandas, how do you view all the columns (also called exploring the dataset to see what 
features exists)?
- dataset.drop("1stColumnName: 0", axis=1).columns

How would you go about performing multivaraiate analysis?
- the data has multiple parameters (columns)/variables
- the data contains both quantitative and qualitative parameters.
- identify the parameters of interest. Remove the parameters unrelated to the analysis.
 
How do you identify which parameters may be related?
- find associations
- you can start by speculating
- based on the speculation, where you've compartmentalize the paramaters, 
- plot a scatter plot - see if associations are linear
- use seaborn's pairplot(dataset, vars["ColumnName", "ColumnName", "ColumnName", "ColumnName"])
- select the associations most linear for further analysis
- determine the degree and direction of those associations, by using covariance.

Why use covariance?
- covariance is a measure of how much two random variables change together. It helps measure the direction and strenght (degree) of the 
  linear association between a pair of numeric variables.
- "use covariance to assess the direction of the relationship but not its strength" 
- when the covariance between two variables is positive, they tend to move in the same direction.
  - that is, higher values of one variable tend to correspond with higher values of the other variable.
  - e.g. time studying and grade
- a negative covariance signifies that the variables move in opposite directions. 
  - higher values of one variable tend to correspond with lower values of the other variable.
  - e.g. rainfall and time spent outside

True or false. Both covariance and correlation can be used to assess the direction of the linear relationship between variables.
- True, correlation also tells us its strenght and is comparable across different units and datasets.
- correlation standardies the results by providing values between -1 and 1 that do not depend on the data's scale.
- covariance does not include standardization.

How do you calculate covariance in python?
- x.cov(y)
- where x and y are data frame obejcts.
 - e.g. cars["EngineSize"].cov(cars["MPG.city"])

What does dataset.shape[0]-1 does in python?
- ...

How would you create the covariance matric among different parameters in a data set in python?
- cars[["ColumnName","ColumnName","ColumnName","ColumnName"]].cov()

Why can't use two covariance values to compare assumptions, directly?
- covariance involves the use of the means of participating variables.
- use correlation instead - which measures the strength and direction of the linear associations between two quantitative
  variables.
- correlation is normalized covariance and is generally obtained by dividing the covariance by the product of standard
  deviation of the variables.

how do you distinguish the correlation on a sample and a population?
- for a sample the correlation would be represented by an italic lower letter "r"
- for a population it would be the letter "p"

How is the strenght of a linear association by using correlation determined ?
- the closer r/p is to +1 the stronger the linear association - positive association
- the closer r/p is to 0, then the variables might be statistically independent - no linear association.
- if its less than 0, it signifies a negative association 

What are the different types of correlation?
- Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall

How would you determine which of these correlation measurements to use?
- the decision would be on the type of variable, the nature of its distribution and the monotocity of the association.

How do you know when an association between two variables is monotonic?
- when two variables x and y where y=f(x), if and only if the value of y is either entirely increasing or decreasing 
  as x increases.

Describe which correlation method would be best suited based on the ype of variable, the nature of its distribution and the monotocity of the association?
Correlation	Type 				Normal Distribution	Should be monotonic
Pearson: 	Interval or Ration		Mandatory		Not Mandatory
Spearman:	Interval, Ordinal or Ratio	Not Mandatory		Mandatory
Kendall:	Interval, Ordinal or Ratio	Not Mandatory		Mandatory
 
Pearson Correlation
When to use Peason Correlation?
- on numeric variables pulled out of a distribution that is normally distributed.
- These numeric variables have to be of the interval or ratio scale.

What can the QQplot be used for as well?
- to se if the underlying data is normally distributed. (statsmodels.api as sm; sm.qqplot(cars[]))
- he Shapiro-Wilk test can also be used to determine normal distribution (scipy.stats import shapiro; shapiro(cars[]))

What is the range of correlation?
- -1 to + 1
-  the closer to 1 suggest strong positve correlation, the opposite suggest strong negative correlation
- closer to 0 suggest no correlation...

When to use Spearman Correlation?
- this is a rank based coeffiecient, where the variables need not be normally distributed. 
- It is mandatory for these variables to be either in interval, ordinal, or ratio scale.
- It is expected that the association between the variables is monotonic.

When to use spearman correlation?
- when the p-value is less than the chosen alpha-value/significance value (0.05) 

What is the Kendall Tau Correlation?
- its a rank based coefficient similiar to Spearman correlation, where the variabes need not be normally distributed. However, it is mandatory
   for these variables to be either in interval, ordinal or ratio scale. In addition, it is expected that the association 
   between the variables is monotonic.

What are concordant pairs?
What are discordant pairs?

What factors of caution should be considered when computing correlation?
- correlation is not the right measure for finding association for non-linear relationships. To determine if two variables may be linear related, 
   a scatter plot can be used.
- Pearson correlation can be affected by outliers. A box plot can be used to identify the presence of outliers. The effect of outliers isi minimal
   for Spearman correlation, therefore, if outliers cannot be manipulated or eliminated from the analysis with proper justification, Spearman
   correlation is preferred.
- A coorelation value close to 0 indicates that the variables are not linearly associated, however these variables may still be related. Thus it is
   advised to plot the data.
- Correlation does not imply causation i.e. based on the value of correlation, it cannot be asserted that one varaible causes the other.

Is covariance and correlation metrics appropriate for finding associations between categorical variables?
- No

How do we determine the relationship between two categorical variables?
- by using a Two-way tables, then a Chi-squared test to determine the existence of an association on the two-way table.

What tests would you perform on these variables based on their types?
Outcome (Dependent), Predictor (Indepent)		Test?
Categorical		Categorical		= Chi-squared
Categorical		Numeric			= Logistic Regression
Numeric			Categorical		= T test, ANOVA
Numeric			Numeric			= Spearman Correlation, Linear regression

Which of the following statements are TRUE about Chi-Squared Test for association between categorical and categorical variables? 
- The chi-squared test is performed with the null hypothesis as the variables are independent
- The null hypothesis is rejected when the obtained p-value is lesser than the chosen significance level

How can the existence of the association between binary variables be determined?
- by using the Phi coefficient
- The Phi coefficient is determined using the two-way table between the binary variables. 
- The two binary variables are said to be positively associated if most of the data fall along the diagonal.

True or False:
The Phi coefficient is also the Pearson correlation coefficient for two binary variables.
- True

What is market basket analysis?
- What items are purchased most frequently.
- which item(s) encourage customers to purchase additional items.
- What are the associations between items.

How can we determine the most frequent purhased item?
- by drawing a frequency table
- by drawing a bar plot

From the frequency table we can see associations between purchased items. What meausure can we use to determine if these
associations are of interest?
- the support and confidence measure

What is Support and Confidence?
- it indicates how interesting an association rule is.
- Support indicates the usefulness of the rule
- Confidence indicates the certainty of the rule.
-- For a given associaition x -> y, support indicates the fraction of transactions that contain both x and y. The confidence
   indicates the fraction of transactions that contain both x and y among the transactions that contain x.

Can the association rule be summarized using a Two-way table?
- Yes

What additional metrics can be used to determine whether association rules are sufficiently interesting enough?
- additional metrics such as lift, conviction and leverage can be used.

How is lift calculated?
- For an association rule represented as x â†’ y, Lift is calculated by the ratio of the confidence of the association and 
  the number of transactions containing the rule consequent. Where x is the antecedent and y is the consequent of the rule.
- This measure indicates the relationship between x and y by measuring their strength of the association.
- that is, the confidence of the association rule (x -> y) over the support of y, where support(y) equals the number of 
  transactions containing y over the total number of transactions.
- Larger values of lift indicate stronger association because lift indicates the strength of association.
  - if lift = 1, then x and y are said to be disassociated/statistically independent. The presence of x may have no influence of the presence of y 
  - if lift >1, then and y are said to be positively associated i.e. the presence of x tends to indicate the presence of y.
  - if lift < 1, then x and y are said to be negatively associated.

What measurement would be convenient if you are looking for associations between large data sets, with a consinderable large
number of items and transactions?
- The Apriori technique

What python module represents the apriori method?
- mlxtend
- we can use this method to mine association rules.

Apriori Technique is used to determine frequent itemsets based on which of the following? 
- Minimum support threshold
